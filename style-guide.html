    <h1>Style &amp; Citation Manual</h1>
    <h2>Datelines</h2>
      <p>Datelines at the beginning of a letter or paper are set at the right side of the page, the originating office in caps and small caps, the address and date in italics. Thus:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="text-align:right">
          <span style="font-variant:small-caps">The White House,</span>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
          <br>
          <i>Washington, DC, January 1, 2016.</i>&emsp;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If the originating office is not given, then the address is set in caps and small caps and the date in italic. Thus:
        <blockquote style="text-align:right">
          <span style="font-variant:small-caps">The White House</span>, <i>July 30, 2016.&emsp;</i>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If only the date is given, then the date is set in caps and small caps. Thus:
          <blockquote style="text-align:right">
            <span class="small-caps">January 24, 2016.</span>&emsp;
          </blockquote>
      </p>

        <dd>There is an ongoing dispute about whether the proper spelling of this term is one or two words. The contemporary consensus is the one-word form. The evolution of this consensus is documented in a pair of memoranda the United States Geological Survey issued. <i>Compare</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">U.S. Geological Survey, Ground Water Branch, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230601043532/https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/memos/memo.php?id=1740">Technical Memorandum GW1975.03</a></span>, <i>Re: Ground water versus groundwater</i> (Aug. 22, 1974) (concluding that &ldquo;ground water&rdquo; is correct), <i>with</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">U.S. Geological Survey, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230601045348/https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/memos/memo.php?id=1397">Technical Memorandum GW2009.03</a></span>, <i>Re: Ground water vs. groundwater</i> (Mar. 26, 2009) (concluding that &ldquo;groundwater&rdquo; is correct).</dd>

        <dd class="indent">
          Notwithstanding the contemporary consensus, there are times when use of the two-word form is preferable.

    <h1>Form of Citations</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The citation forms articulated herein can be used in any form of writing.</p>
    <h2>Case Names</h2>
      <h3>United States Reports</h3>
      <p>The first 90 volumes of the United States Reports (U.S.) were originally cited with reference to the Reporter of Decisions. This was because the first ninety volumes were privately published. In 1874, Congress began to fund the publication of what is now the U.S. Reports. The first ninety volumes were renumbered retroactively. While the first ninety volumes may be cited without reference to the Reporter, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), <span class="small-caps">The Bluebook</span> recommends the citation to include a parenthetical reference to the Reporter.</p>
