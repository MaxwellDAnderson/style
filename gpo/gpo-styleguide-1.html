    <h1>16. Datelines, Address, and Signatures</h1>
      <p>
        <b>16.1.</b> The general principle involved in the typography of datelines, addresses, and signatures is that they should be set to stand out clearly from the body of the letter or paper that they accompany. This is accomplished by using caps and small caps and italic, as set forth below. other typographic details are designed to ensure uniformity and good appearance. Street addresses and ZIP Code numbers are not to be used. In certain lists that carry ZIP Code numbers, regular spacing will be used preceding the ZIP Code. Certain general instructions apply alike to datelines, addresses, and signatures.
      </p>
    
    <h2>General Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        <b>16.2.</b> Principal words in datelines, addresses, and titles accompanying signatures are capitalized.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>16.3.</b>
        <i>Mr.</i>, <i>Mrs.</i>, <i>Miss</i>, <i>Ms.</i>, and all other titles preceding a name, and <i>Esq.</i>, <i>Jr.</i>, <i>Sr.</i>, and <i>2d</i> following a name in address and signature lines, are set in roman caps and lowercase if the name is in caps and small caps or caps and lowercase; if the name is in caps, they are set in caps and small caps, if small caps are available&mdash;otherwise in caps and lowercase.
      </p>
    <h3>Spacing</h3>
      <p>
        <b>16.4.</b>
        At least 2 points of space should appear between dateline and text or address, address and text, text and signature, or signature and address.
      </p>
    <h3>Datelines</h3>
      <p>
        <b>16.5.</b>
        Datelines at the beginning of a letter or paper are set at the right side of the page. The key elements of the dateline are the originating office, the address, and the date. How far each element is indented right depends on the width of the measure and how many elements are present. The style of each element depends on how many of the elements are present.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>16.5.1.</b>
        The number of lines a dateline occupies determines by how much each line is indented from the right.
